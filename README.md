# Transcendence

The last project of the 42 common core.

This project is **single page application** that allows users to create accounts, log in, and play a game of pong against other users.

The project is divided into three main parts:

-   **Web Sockets and algorithms**: The game is played in real time from different clients, using **web sockets** to communicate the game state between the clients and the server.

-   **Frontend**: A **vanilla JS** fronted that accts as a **single page application**, requesting the data to the backend and updating the DOM accordingly. And using **Bootstrap** for the styling of the page.

-   **Backend**: A Django server that provides an API for the frontend to interact with using **Django-Ninja** and using **Postgres** as a database. It also manages the game state and the web sockets connections.

This project runs in **Docker**. Using three containers:

-   **Django** (API and backend) üêç

-   **Postgres** (database) üóÑÔ∏è

-   **Nginx** (frontend) üåê
